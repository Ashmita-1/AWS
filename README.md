DATA IS THE NEW OIL

1. **CLOUD COMPUTING** - is the delivery of computing services wherein they provide <u>servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence</u> over the internet ("the cloud") for faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. <br> <br>

2. **Benefits of Cloud**
   - ***Faster time to market*** - Instead of investing funds in creating a new data structure, org rely on clouds like AWS and utilise these funds in their business.
     
   - ***Scalability and flexibility*** - cloud offers an **unlimited amount of virtual resources**
     
   - ***Cost savings*** 
     
   - ***Better collaboration*** - teams can still collaborate in different geographical regions.
     
   - ***Advanced security*** - cloud ensures data security.
     
   - ***Data loss prevention*** - customers cant lose their data in **S3**. <br> <br>
  
3. **Disadvantages of Cloud**
   - ***Risk of vendor lock-in***- it's **impossible** for the organisation to move from one cloud to another. 
     
   - ***Less control over underlying cloud infrastructure*** - If a company wants more control of their compliance(at the under-neath layer), then it must refrain from using the cloud.
     
   - ***Concerns about security risks like data privacy and online threats*** 
     
   - ***Integration complexity with existing systems*** 
     
   - ***Unforeseen costs and unexpected expenses.*** <br> <br>
  
4. **Gartner's Magic Quadrant** -  A big org that does analytics part. <br> <br>

5. **Public Cloud vs Private Cloud** -

   
  |Public Cloud|Private Cloud|
  |------------|-------------|
   | a. Hosted at **service provider** site. | a. Hosted at **Enterprise or Service Provider** site.|
   |b. Supports connectivity over the Internet. | b. Supports connectivity over internet/private network(WAN)|
   |c. Suitable for information not very sensitive. | c. Suitable for very sensitive information|
   |d. Cheaper than Private cloud. | d. Costlier than the public cloud.|
   |e. Utilises shared infrastrucure.| e. Doesn't utilise shared infrastgucture.|
   |f. Supports multiple customers.| f. Supports **one** customer.|
   |g. Requires **high level** of security| g. Requires **medium level** security.|
   |h. May use VLANs, access list, VRF file,  MPLs to logic||
   |i. Eg: Open Nebula|i. Eg: Eucalyptus|
